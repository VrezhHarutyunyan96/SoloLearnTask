     * Create a news feed application with the following functionality:
     *
     * ·  The data should be pulled from http://open-platform.theguardian.com/documentation/search,
     * using JSON format. The articles should include a title, an image and category.    +
     *
     *
     *
     * ·  The home page should be an infinite scrolling list of the articles
     * (optional: ability to switch from list view to Pinterest-like view).
     * Scrolling down the list should pull the next items from the feed. +
     *
     *
     *
     * ·  Tapping an article should open it in a new page with shared element transition of the image. +
     *
     *
     *
     * ·  Ability to save the article for offline use. The app should be able to open the offline items without network connection. +
     *
     *
     *
     * ·  Ability to Pin items to the home page view using an icon in the article view page.
     * The pinned items should be listed in a horizontal scrolling view on top of the home page list.
     * When pinning an article, the new item should be reflected in the list dynamically, upon going back to the home page. -
     *
     *
     *
     * ·  The app should check for new items in the feed and add them to the list every 30 seconds. -
     *
     *
     *
     * ·  A background task to check for new items and generate a notification that new items are available.
     *  (The notification should be generated when the app is closed or taken to the background) -
     *
     *
     *
     * Please also focus on the UI/UX of the app, as that is equally important. -
